# VolleyballRosterScraping
--A Python project built from Playwright and BeautifulSoup to scrape volleyball roster data--

The code will open the link specified, pull player names and positions, and then write that information to a csv file with their team name.

I flipped between the links manually, changing the team name each time, though I am sure there is a way to better automate that. In this case, 
there are only seven teams so it was quicker for me to do that.
